# CS2 Marketplace IDs

Most tradable CS2 in-game items' Name/ID pairs from various item marketplaces such as [buff163](https://buff.163.com), [Youpin898 (UU)](https://www.youpin898.com/) and [buff.market](https://buff.market/) can be found here including [Austin 2025](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/529847413482979949) and [Spring Forward](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/529842339955343453) items. All items' Goods IDs, Applied Sticker IDs (including exclusively pre-applied stickers), Applied Patch IDs, Doppler Phase IDs and some items' pattern tiers can be found within a single JSON file.<br>

Some known missing items and Doppler phases that is seen to exist/not exist which aren't registered on buff163 and Youpin898 are also listed here.<br>

IDs of the phases for the new Minimal Wear Doppler knives in the Fever Case for buff163, the missing Austin 2025 Highlight Charms for Youpin898 and most missing items' goods IDs for buff.market will be added as soon as possible.<br>

Some stickers and patches can have other Sticker/Patch ID-Name pairs on buff163 with the name being the same that have a lower quantity of listings of the same kind of sticker applied (e.g. Rush 4x20 (Holo), CRUC1AL | Paris 2023)<br>
