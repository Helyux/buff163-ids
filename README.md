# CS2 Marketplace IDs

Most tradable CS2 in-game items' Name/ID pairs from various item marketplaces such as [buff163](https://buff.163.com) and [Youpin898 (UU)](https://www.youpin898.com/) can be found here including [Shanghai 2024](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4472732402493426409), [The Armory](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/armory) and [Masterminds 2 Music Kit Box](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4273439871236872890) items. All items' Goods IDs, Applied Sticker IDs (including exclusively pre-applied stickers), Applied Patch IDs, Doppler Phase IDs and some items' pattern tiers can be found within a single JSON file.<br>

Some known missing items and Doppler phases that is seen to exist/not exist which aren't registered on buff163 and Youpin898 are also listed here.<br>

Some stickers and patches can have other Sticker/Patch ID-Name pairs on buff163 with the name being the same that have a lower quantity of listings of the same kind of sticker applied (e.g. Rush 4x20 (Holo), CRUC1AL | Paris 2023)<br>
